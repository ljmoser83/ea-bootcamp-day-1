    "## Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lesson on Open Reproducible Science, you learned that `Jupyter Notebook` is a web-based interactive development environment (IDE) that allows you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write and run code interactively\n",
    "* Share your work with colleagues so they can see both your code and the code outputs. \n",
    "* Document all aspects of your workflow using a combination of well written programming code (e.g. `Python`) and `Markdown` text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This functionality supports open reproducible science by facilitating and supporting collaboration and documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The components of `Jupyter Notebook` include:\n",
    "1. **The Jupyter Notebook IDE** The `Jupyter Notebook` interactive development environment (IDE) is the web application that launches in a web browser like Firefox or Safari and is the environment where you write and run your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Notebook documents (.ipynb files)** The notebook document is a file type that you can use to store your `Python` code and `Markdown` text. A `Jupyter Notebook` file has an `.ipynb` extension (e.g. `jpalomino-homework-1.ipynb`)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Kernels** A kernel runs your code in a specific programming language. `Jupyter Notebook` supports over 40 different languages. In this class, you will use `Python`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Jupyter Notebook` also provides functionality for making the coding process more efficient such as keyboard short-cuts as well as auto-complete options using the `Tab` button. You will review this functionality in the hands-on activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markdown \n",
    "\n",
    "`Markdown` is a human readable syntax for formatting text documents and can be used to produce nicely formatted documents including .pdf files and web pages (e.g. .html files). When you format text using `Markdown` in a document, it is similar to using the formatting tools (bold, heading 1, heading 2, etc) in a word processing tool like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, instead of using buttons to apply formatting, you use syntax such as `**this syntax bolds text in Markdown**` or `# Here is a heading in Markdown`. `Markdown` allows you to format text - such as making headings, italics, bold, and bulleted lists, - add hyperlinks to websites (e.g. URLs), make tables, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, this webpage that you are looking at right now (and all of the hands-on exercises in this course) use Markdown for formatting!\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `Markdown` within `Jupyter Notebook` provides an easy and visually-appealing way to document your code's workflow, provide details on your data, and describe your output and results within a single `Jupyter Notebook` file (.ipynb).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully, by now you understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How the `Jupyter Notebook` environment works\n",
    "2. How Jupyter supports open reproducible science through combining programming code, displaying output, and documentation with `Markdown`."

    "\n",
    "It is ideal (but not required) to launch `Jupyter Notebook` from the working directory where all of the notebook files that you wish to use live. In this case, these files are in the `earth-analytics-bootcamp` directory.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. change the current directory to your desired working directory. In this case: `~/earth-analytics-bootcamp`\n",
